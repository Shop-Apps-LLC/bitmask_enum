# BitmaskEnum

A bitmask enum attribute for ActiveRecord.

Aiming to be lightweight and performant, providing the core functionality for the use of a bitmask enum model attribute.

Supporting Ruby 2.4+ and Rails 4.2+.

Credit is due to Joel Moss' gem [bitmask_attributes](https://github.com/joelmoss/bitmask_attributes). I came across it while considering if I should write a gem for this. It's great work and some elements of it inspired this gem, I just had my own thoughts about how I'd like the gem to operate, and wanted some more end-to-end experience on gem production so I decided to create this rather than pick up the torch on that repo.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'bitmask_enum'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install bitmask_enum

## Usage

In the model, the bitmask enum is added in a similar way to enums. Given an integer attribute called `attribs`, flags of `flag` and `flag2`, adding the `flag_prefix` option with the value `type`, the following line would be used:

```ruby
bitmask_enum attribs: [:flag, :flag2], flag_prefix: 'type'
```

The `bitmask_enum` class method is used to add the bitmask enum, which then goes on to add numerous helper methods to the model:

### `bitmask_enum`

`bitmask_enum params`

#### params

**Type:** Hash

The first key of this hash should be the name of the integer attribute to be modeled as a bitmask enum. The value of that key should be an array of symbols or strings representing the flags that will be part of the bitmask.

Any following keys are optional and should define options for the enum. The current accepted keys are:
- `flag_prefix` - A symbol or string that will prefix all the created method names for individual flags
  - The gem will prepend the provided value to the flag with an underscore, e.g. `pre` would become `pre_flag`
- `flag_suffix` - A symbol or string that will suffix all the created method names for individual flags
  - The gem will append the provided value to the flag with an underscore, e.g. `post` would become `flag_post`

### The following methods will be created on the model instance:

### `{flag}?`

**No params**

For each flag, this method will be created.

The method checks whether a flag is enabled or not.

**Return value:** `boolean` - reflects whether the flag is enabled for the instance.

### `{flag}!`

**No params**

For each flag, this method will be created.

The method toggles the current setting of the flag.

**Return value:** `boolean` - true if the update of the attribute was successful. Raises error if update was unsuccessful.

### `enable_{flag}!`

**No params**

For each flag, this method will be created.

The method enables the the flag is it is disabled, otherwise it takes no action.

**Return value:** `boolean` - true if the update of the attribute was successful. Raises error if update was unsuccessful.

### `disable_{flag}!`

**No params**

For each flag, this method will be created.

The method disables the the flag is it is enabled, otherwise it takes no action.

**Return value:** `boolean` - true if the update of the attribute was successful. Raises error if update was unsuccessful.

### `{attribute}_settings`

**No params**

This method will be created once on the instance.

The method returns a hash with the flags as keys and their current settings as values. The keys will be symbols.

**Return value:** `hash` - hash with flags as keys and their current settings as values. E.g. `{ flag_one: true, flag_two: false }`

### `{attribute}`

**No params**

This method will be created once on the instance.

The method returns an array of all enabled flags on the instance. The items will be symbols.

**Return value:** `array` - array of enabled flags. E.g. `[:flag_one, :flag_two]`

---

### The following methods will be created on the model class:

### `{flag}_enabled`

**No params**

For each flag, this method will be created on the class.

The method is a scope of all records for which the flag is enabled.

**Return value:** `ActiveRecord::Relation` - a collection of all records for which the flag is enabled.

### `{flag}_disabled`

**No params**

For each flag, this method will be created on the class.

The method is a scope of all records for which the flag is disabled.

**Return value:** `ActiveRecord::Relation` - a collection of all records for which the flag is disabled.

### `{attribute}`

**No params**

This method will be created once on the class.

The method returns an array of all the defined flags. The items can be strings or symbols depending on which you used for the enum definition.

**Return value:** `array` - array of defined flags. E.g. `[:flag_one, :flag_two]`
